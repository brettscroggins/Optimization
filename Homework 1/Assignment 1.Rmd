## Problem 2

```{r}
# Initialize A and b
b = matrix(c(1,0,.25,.15),4,1)
A = matrix(c(1,.45,0,.14,1,-.55,1,.2,1,0,0,.2,1,0,0,.1),4,4)

# Solve for percents and amounts
percents = solve(A) %*% b
print(percents)

amounts = percents*100
print(amounts)
```

## Problem 4

```{r}
# Initialize A and b
b = matrix(c(-45,-3,-31,-45,18,8,20,2,-27,-38,0),11,1)
A = matrix(c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,1,1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,-1,1),11,5)

# Solve for A_hat and b_hat
A_hat = t(A) %*% A
b_hat = t(A) %*% b

# Solve for ranks with A_hat and b_hat
ranks = solve(A_hat) %*% b_hat
print(ranks)
